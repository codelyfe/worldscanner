# World Scanner
Let's discover all the vulnerabilities before the hackers do!

## How can we do so?
By working together to make an APP that is already created BETTER for professionals to use to create a ZERO risk world.

## First we must look at RISK's
1. If this program is used by the wrong people it could be dangerous for the internet.

## Second we will look at the POSITIVE's
1. Locate devices all over the world and discover vunerable servers and devices and help fix them before a hacker decideds to cause harm.
2. Discover a cluster of drones or foreign UFO's that can cause risk to our boarders.

# How Reliable is this program?
After running this program for 7 days I was able to collect 80k devices in the world that were at risk of being exploited. This is not a RISK I am willing to take when it comes to the future of TECHNOLOGY. If we are ever going to overcome hackers we MUST strike first. My program ALLOWS me to find these devices in 4.6ms using only a Rasp. Pi. This is incrediable. 

## How can we keep each other safe?
By working together to build something that could protect the future of our world as we know it.
